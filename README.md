# 🚀 React Learning from Scratch

Welcome to my personal React learning repository!  
This repo documents my journey as I learn React step by step — practicing core concepts, building mini projects, and understanding the fundamentals deeply.

## 📁 Folder Structure

### `01-Basics/`
In this folder, I practiced:

-  **Conditional Rendering** – using `if`/`else`, logical operators and ternary operators to display different UI.
-  **Props** – passing, destructuring and using props to build reusable components.
-  **Event Handlers** – handling events like `onClick`, `onMouseMove`, `onCopy`, and understanding why we use callback functions in JSX.

Each file contains simple, focused examples to reinforce the concepts.

### `02-State_and_hooks/`
This folder focuses on:

-  **State Management with `useState`** – learning how to declare, update, and use state in functional components.
-  **Controlled Inputs** – binding input values to state and handling user input changes.
-  **useEffect Hook** – syncing React state with `localStorage`, and running effects conditionally on state changes.
-  **Mini Projects** – like a simple name input app that remembers user input even after a page refresh!

These examples helped me understand how React handles data internally and reactively updates the UI.

### `03-portal_and_key/`
This folder includes:

- **React Portals** – rendering child components outside the main DOM hierarchy while preserving React's event system. Used in scenarios like modals and tooltips.
- **Keys in Lists** – learning why keys are essential for list rendering performance and how to use them effectively to prevent unwanted re-renders.

These concepts are critical for building scalable and efficient UIs.
