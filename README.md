# 🚀 React Learning from Scratch

Welcome to my personal React learning repository!  
This repo documents my journey as I learn React step by step — practicing core concepts, building mini projects, and understanding the fundamentals deeply.

## 📁 Folder Structure

### `01-Basics/`
In this folder, I practiced:

-  **Conditional Rendering** – using `if`/`else`, logical operators and ternary operators to display different UI.
-  **Props** – passing, destructuring and using props to build reusable components.
-  **Event Handlers** – handling events like `onClick`, `onMouseMove`, `onCopy`, and understanding why we use callback functions in JSX.

Each file contains simple, focused examples to reinforce the concepts.
